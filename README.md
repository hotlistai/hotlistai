## Hey, I’m Johnny 👋

I build things that actually get used.

I’m a full stack developer and operator focused on shipping real products in real markets. My work lives at the intersection of software, real estate, and applied AI, not demos, not toys, not theory.

### What I’m building now

**Hotlist AI**  
A product studio shipping focused SaaS tools instead of bloated platforms. Each product solves one painful bottleneck, cleanly and fast.

**Solar in Overdrive** ☀️  
A growth and systems engine for solar companies. Lead flow, validation, follow up, and conversion, engineered for operators who care about margins, not vanity metrics.

**Counterpart Products**  
Parallel builds and internal tools that support sales, ops, and automation across real estate, solar, and service businesses. Quietly powerful. Intentionally boring in the best way.

### What I’ve shipped (and closed)

**Lyft Email**  
Built, shipped, validated, and sunset. Mission complete. On to better problems.

### How I work

- Build small, sharp systems that compound
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Ship first, refine second
- Kill products that stop earning their keep
- Design for operators, not spectators

I wake up early, work deep, and obsess over removing friction. ADHD brain, so I optimize for clear bottlenecks and fast execution.

### Tech stack (varies by project)

- TypeScript, Node, React, Next.js
- Postgres, Redis, event driven workflows
- AI where it actually creates leverage
- Clean infra, minimal ceremony

### Open to

- Collaborating with builders who ship
- Partnering with operators who know their numbers
- Conversations that start with “this is broken, can we fix it?”

If something here resonates, you already know how to reach me.

⚡ Fun fact: I care more about systems that survive than products that trend.
